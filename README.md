# KnowYourScales

KnowYourScales is a simple project designed to make the life of a musician easier. The simple & minimalistic interface allows the user to quickly get the desired information - what notes are in what scale?

# Explanation for Non-Musicians
Our music consists of notes. Western music knows twelve of them: C C# D D# E F F# G G# A A# B. If you were to play all of these notes together, it wouldn't sound good. Luckily there are guidelines that indicate what notes should be played together. These are called 'scales'. A scale contain seven notes that sound good together. Songwriting is a complicated process, but nearly every song on the radio is written by using one of those scales. Scales are essential for musicians. An improvising musician for example knows the scale of a song and just plays around with the corresponding notes - the outcome will sound good (of course there is more to this, but that's the general idea). One example is the C Major scale: C D E F G A B. But music theory does not stop there - it even tells musicians, what emotions certain scales evoke. The said Major scale is known to sound happy. There is of course the opposite, the Minor scale: C D Eb F G Ab Bb. And there is the Dorian scale, which has a melancholic and kind of hopeful sound to it: C D Eb F G A Bb. These were just three examples, all based on C as the starting note. There are seven different scales: Major, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Minor & Locrian. And there are 12 different notes. This results in 94 different scales - which is a lot to remember. Of course you could just google it. This is funnily enough quite hard, as there is no website that just simply displays all scales with their corresponding notes - and this is where KnowYourScales! comes into play. You simply select your note, your scale and all the notes pop up on the screen.
