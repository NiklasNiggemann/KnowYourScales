# KnowYourScales

KnowYourScales is a simple project designed to make the life of a musician easier. The simple & minimalistic interface allows the user to quickly get the desired information - what notes are in what scale?

Explanation for Non-Musicians 
Our music consists of notes. Western music knows twelve of them: C C# D D# E F F# G G# A A# B. If you were to play all of these notes together, it wouldn't sound good. Luckily there are guidelines, which notes sounds good together. These are 'scales' and those contain seven of those twelve notes that sound good together. The C Major Scale for example: C D E F G A B. But music theory does not stop there - it even tells musicians, what emotions certain scales evoke. The said Major scale is known to sound happy. There is of course the opposite, the Minor scale: C D Eb F G Ab Bb. And there is the Dorian scale, which has a melancholic and kind of hopeful sound to it: C D Eb F G A Bb. These were just three examples, all based on C as the starting note. This c note alone has 7 different scales. There are 12 notes, which results in 94 different scales. That's a lot to remember. And funnily enough - sometimes it's quite hard to just 'google' what notes are in which scale. I've encountered this problem many times myself. And this is where this website comes into play. You simply select your note, your scale and all the notes pop up on the screen.
